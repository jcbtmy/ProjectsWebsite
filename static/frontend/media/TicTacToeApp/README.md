    This game is a simple version of TicTacToe built with basic html and css elements.
    The game has two modes for the bot, easy and hard, as well as a reset button that can be clicked at any time. The bot's Easy mode is just a random move selection while the Hard setting utilizes the MinMax algorithm with Alpha-Beta tree pruning to make it a bit quicker.
